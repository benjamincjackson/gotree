This repository is a fork of the amazing [gotree](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree) ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/3/lqab075/6348148)), stripped to some bare essentials in order to use its tree structure in
some projects.

Gotree's licence is reproduced in the root of this repository.

Changes to gotree's source code can be viewed in the commit history of this repository. Any mistakes are my own.
